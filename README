Apache2::AuthColloquy is an Apache 2 authentication module. It will
authenticate against a Colloquy users.lua user database file using
the newer password2 field.

This script munges the users.lua file in to executable perl code
which is then evaluated. It should therefore be used with caution
if you cannot gaurentee the integrity of the users.lua file.
